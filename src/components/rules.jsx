        Welcome to the Memory Game! The objective of the game is simpleâ€”click on
        all 12 unique cards without selecting the same card twice. Each time you
        click a card, the board will shuffle, making it more challenging to
        remember your previous choices. If you accidentally click the same card
        twice, the game will end immediately. To win, you must successfully
        select all 12 cards in a row without repeating any. Stay focused, test
        your memory, and see if you can complete the challenge. Good luck! ðŸŽ®ðŸ§
