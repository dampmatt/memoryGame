        Welcome to the Memory Game! Test your memory and concentration by
        finding matching pairs of cards. The game begins with all 12 cards
        placed face-down. Click on any two cards to reveal them—if they match,
        they stay face-up; if not, they will flip back after a short delay. Keep
        playing until all pairs are found! Each successful match earns 1 point,
        and the goal is to complete the game with the fewest moves possible.
        Think fast, remember well, and try to beat your best score! 🎯🃏
