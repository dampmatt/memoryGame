# Memory Game

Welcome to the **Memory Game**! This is a fun and challenging game designed to test your memory and focus. Click on unique cards to score points, but be careful—clicking the same card twice will end the game!

## 🚀 How to Play

- Click on any card to start the game.
- Each time you click a card, the board will shuffle.
- Avoid clicking the same card twice.
- The goal is to click all **12 unique cards** in a row without repetition.
- If you click the same card twice, the game ends.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** – for building the user interface
- **Context API** – for state management
- **PokeAPI** – for fetching Pokémon images
- **CSS** – for styling and animations
